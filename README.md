# detox

E2E tests and automation library for mobile

## Development still in progress!

## Wanna see it in action??

#### Step 1: Run the server

1. git clone the repo at http://github.com/wix/detox-server
2. open the `detox-server` folder
3. `npm install`
4. run the server with `npm start`
5. you should see `server listening on localhost:8099...`

#### Step 2: Run the example iOS project in the simulator

1. git clone the repo at http://github.com/wix/detox
2. open the `detox/example` folder
3. `npm install`
4. open `detox/example/ios/example.xcodeproj` in xcode
5. make sure you don't have any running RN packagers
6. run the project by pressing play
7. you should see an app in the simulator with "Welcome" and "Click Me" button, the iOS Accessibility Inspector might also show up
8. if you get weird "DerivedData" errors, change the xcode "DerivedData" setting back to default

#### Step 3: Run the e2e test

1. open a new terminal in `detox/example` folder
2. `npm run e2e`
3. the test will click the "Click Me" button, verify that there's a "Yay" label in next screen and then check if there's a "Mitzi" label - there is no such label so the **test will fail**

#### Step 4: Let's fix the test

1. reload the app by clicking `CMD+R`
2. edit the file `detox/example/e2e/example.spec.js`
3. in line 91 change "Mitzi" to "Yay" like the comment says
4. re-run the test `npm run e2e`
5. the test will hopefully now pass

#### Some implementation details

* We use websockets to communicate (so it should be super fast and bi-directional)
* Both the app and the tester are clients, so we need the server to proxy between them
* We are relying on EarlGrey as our grey-box native library for iOS (espresso for Android later on)
* The JS tester controls EarlGrey by remote using a strange JSON protocol
* Instead of wrapping the zillion API calls EarlGrey supports, we implemented a reflection mechanism
* So the JS tester in low level actually invokes the native methods.. freaky
* That's why the `detox/example/e2e/example.spec.js` looks like it does
* In the future we will abstract all of this in JS so you'll have a nice concise API
* See everything EarlGrey supports [here](https://github.com/google/EarlGrey/blob/master/docs/api.md) and in this [cheatsheet](https://github.com/google/EarlGrey/blob/master/docs/cheatsheet/cheatsheet.pdf)
* In the future we'll use [fbsimctl](https://github.com/facebook/FBSimulatorControl) to control the simulator from the test, restart the app, etc
