# Configuration Options 

### Device Configuration
`configurations` holds all the device configurations, if there is only one configuration in `configurations` `detox build` and `detox test` will default to it, to choose a specific configuration use `--configuration` param<br>
	

|Configuration Params|Details|
|---|---|
|`binaryPath`|relative path to the ipa/app due to be  tested (make sure you build the app in a project relative path)|
|`type`|device type, currently only `ios.simulator` is supported|
|`name`|device name, aligns to the device list avaliable through `fbsimctl list` for example, this is one line of the output of `fbsimctl list`: `A3C93900-6D17-4830-8FBE-E102E4BBCBB9 | iPhone 7 | Shutdown | iPhone 7 | iOS 10.2`, ir order to choose the first `iPhone 7` regardless of OS version, use `iPhone 7`. to be OS specific use `iPhone 7, iOS 10.2`|
|`build`| **[optional]** build command (either `xcodebuild`, `react-native run-ios`, etc...), will be later available through detox CLI tool.|
	
	
### Server Configuration
Detox can either initialize a server using a generated configuration, or can be overriden with a manual  configuration:
	
```json
	"detox": {
	  ...
	  "session": {
		"server": "ws://localhost:8099",
		"sessionId": "YourProjectSessionId"
	  }
	}
```

### Test Root Folder


##### Optional: setting a custom test root folder
Applies when using `detox-cli` by running `detox test` command, default is `e2e`.
	
```json
	"detox": {
	  ...
	  "specs": "path/to/tests"
	}
```

### Build Configuration

In your detox config (in package.json) paste your build command into the configuration's `build` field. 
The build command will be triggered when running

You can choose to build your project in any of these ways...

* If there's only one configuration, you can simply use:

	```sh
	detox build
	```

* To choose a specific configuration:
	
	```sh
	detox build --configuration yourConfiguration
	```
* Building with xcodebuild:

	```sh
	xcodebuild -project ios/YourProject.xcodeproj -scheme YourProject -sdk iphonesimulator -derivedDataPath ios/build
	```
	
* Building using React Native, this is the least suggested way of running your build, since it also starts a random simulator and installs the app on it.
	
  ```sh 
  react-native run-ios
  ```

> Note: remember to update the `app` path in your `package.json`.


### Test Configuration
* If there's only one configuration, you can simply use:

	```sh
	detox test
	```
* For multiple configurations, choose your configuration by passing `--configuration` param:
	
	```sh
	detox test --configuration yourConfiguration
	```

### Faster test runs with app reuse
By default the app is removed, reinstalled and launched before each run.
Starting fresh is critical in CI but in dev you might be able to save time between test runs and reuse the app that was previously installed in the simulator. To do so use the `reuse` flag and run your tests like this:

```sh
detox test --reuse
```

This is especially useful with React Native DEV mode when making Javascript code changes that are getting picked up by the packager (and thus no reinstall is needed). This can save up to 7 seconds per run!
You should not use this option if you made native code changes or if your app relies on local ("disk") storage.


### Set Xcode build path
By default, Xcode uses a randomized hidden path for outputting project build artifacts, called DerivedData. For ease of use (and better support in CI environments), it is recommended to change the project build path to a more convenient path.

* With your project opened in Xcode, select menu `File` â–º `Project Settings...`. Click on `Advanced...`, select `Custom` and from the drop-down menu, select `Relative to Derived Data`.
* Build artifacts will now be created in a `DerivedData` folder next to your `xcodeproj` project.
